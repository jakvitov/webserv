- Cache is one of the essential parts of Webserv. 
If enabled, it allows to significantly improve 
speed of the server, by loading given pages from RAM.

- Cache size can be limited in the yaml config and 
its size will never overgrow. Each time we cache 
a new file, we remove the necessary amount of bytes
from cache. Thre removed files are selected from
the least used ones.

- HTTP and HTTPS ports both share the same cache,
but cache does not apply to proxied requests using
the reverse proxy functionality. 

- When cache size is not explictly set, default 
value of 20MB is used, we can disable caching 
completely by setting cache_enabled to false.

- Example cache config is given bellow:

handler:
  content_root: "~/web/"
  max_cache_bytes: 100000000
  cache_enabled: true
