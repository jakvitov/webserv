- The main functions of Webserv are HTTP server and 
proxy routing. This section will elaborate on the 
HTTP serving part.  

- Webserv serves files over a TCP connection using 
the HTTP protocol on a port configured in the 
ports config key. 

- Each request to the server causes Webserv to 
pass the given request to a handler in a new 
goroutine. Goroutines do not map 1:1 to threads,
so the usage of threads will be smaller or equal
(worst case) than in classic thread per request
scenario.

- If the given file is found, than it's returned
with the 200 HTTP status code. If not, then 404
NOT FOUND or 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR is returned
in case of internal server error.

- Additional secifications and restrictions for 
the HTTP requests can be configured in the handler
section of the config file as listed in the example
bellow. 

handler:
  content_root: string
  read_timeout_ms: int
  write_timeout_ms: int
  max_header_bytes: int
  cache_enabled: bool
  max_cache_bytes: int64
