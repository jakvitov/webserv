- Reverse proxy is the second main function of 
the Webserv application, which contributes to its 
usability as a complete facade over all server 
HTTP services.

- Reverse proxy will delegate all requests made to 
given URI to provided port in the config file.
URL of the request will be changed to localhost.

- This allows the user to expose only one or two 
ports (HTTP and HTTPS) and facade with them multiple
HTTP based servers via URI routing. Typical usage 
is one backend server operating on 
http://localhost:9000/api and frontend served with
webserv on https://mywebsite:443/. With apropriate
proxy settings, we achieve routing all requests
with /api prefix to our localhost backend and the
rest on frontend.

- Reverse proxy settings do support REGEX matching.
Each request at proxied endpoint will be matched
with the endpoint name given in the config file 
using the standard POSIX regular expressions.

- Example of reverse proxy setup, to forward all 
requests from all https://url:443/api* to port 
9000 is listed bellow.

ports:
  http_port: 80
  https_port: 443

reverse_proxy:
  routes:
      - from: "/api/*"
        to: 9000

**tls certificate config etc***

- Note that each request is proxied to its target
as HTTP request, thus other services should
communicate over a secure network. Typical usage
involves safe proxying to localhost port.
